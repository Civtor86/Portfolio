# [Project 1: Launching Airbnb Sydney](https://github.com/Civtor86/SQL_Basic_Data_Querying)

* Act as as the General manager for the Sydney area at Airbnb, I want to know more about the different listings of houses your team has onboarded. 
* I have access to information regarding the listings, neighbourhoods, reviews, and calendar. Each of these have their own separate table.
* The data was taken from the following website: https://github.com/sb2nov/sql-cc.git

# [Project 2: Summarize data of Airbnb Sydney](https://github.com/Civtor86/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Copy_of_Victor_B_Sanchez_Week_2_Project_SQLCC.ipynb)

* As the General Manager for the Sydney area at Airbnb, you want to know more about the different listings of houses you onboarded. 
* You have access to information regarding the listings, neighbourhoods, reviews, and calendar. 
* Each of these have their own separate table, and follow the structure as shown in the week 1 project:
* The data was taken from the following website: https://github.com/sb2nov/sql-cc.git

# [Project 3: SQL Data Querying_Using Joins Function on PostGreSQL](https://github.com/Civtor86/SQL_Data_Querying_Using-Join-Project-3)

* This is my Third SQL project where I explore the use of Join Function of SQL by creating and manipulating custom tables using PostGreSQL. 
* The DVD Rental Dataset is taken from the following website: https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/sakila-db.zip.

1. Using the DVD rental dataset, provide the SQL code and the output for this query criterion
    * A.  Using the DVD rental dataset, provide the SQL code and the output for this query criterion. 
        a Provide an Excel sheet report of the total sum of payments made by each customer in the payments table. Present it in ascending order. 
        There should be four columns: customer_id, first_name, last_name`,   and sum.

    * B. Provide the SQL syntax and output of customer IDs having an average payment amount of less than 3.
   
2. Why would the following SQL syntaxes fail?
    * A. SELECT first_name, last_name, district FROM customer INNER JOIN address ON address_id = address_id.
    * B. SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount3 FROM payment GROUP BY customer_id HAVING amount > 100

3. Answer the following business scenario questions. Provide the SQL code and the output.
    * A.   One of the criteria for a customer to become part of the customer loyalty program is that they need to have an accumulated payment made to the DVD rental store of at least                $200 or more. As a data analyst, you need to provide a list of customer IDs with a total accumulated payment of at least $200 or more.

# [Project 4: Analysis of Financing Data for New Investment using PostGreSQL](https://github.com/Civtor86/SQL_Data_Querying_Project-4)

* Task description You are a data analyst working for a company planning to venture   into a new market involving financial services. In line with this,   it is requesting insights on sources of financing companies tap   into when entering the said industry.

* Decision-makers will use insights from your report   for their alternatives analysis as they explore probable   sources of financing to start offering the new service.

* The dataset is a subset from an open data set; should you wish to peruse the source, you can find at the following website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arindam235/startup-investments-crunchbase.

1. Prepare the dataset for the analysis by creating a new table selecting   the records where the market is financial services.   Keep in mind that the values in this column are misspelled

2. Provide descriptive analytics that presents the number of observations of companies operating in financial services and their average, minimum, and maximum seed funding.

3. Aware of the reality that equity crowdfunding is a bit rare in financial services, determine whether or not there has been a previous instance where a startup offering financial services received equity crowdfunding. If there was, provide details of the company, such as the country it operates in, the year it was founded, its status (whether or not it is still operating), and the amount of equity crowdfunding it acquired.

4. Determine whether or not a significant outlier in terms of total funding (USD) exists among companies that offer financial services.   An outlier is an extremely high or low value. Provide details about this outlier,   such as its country, status, year founded, and total funding (USD).

5. Excluding the significant outlier, provide insights on the company regarding the usual financing sources for businesses that offer financial services. Export your data from SQL to MS Excel, and create a data visualization that presents the average funds acquired from financing sources such as equity crowd-sourcing, undisclosed sources, convertible notes, debt financing,   and private equity.

# [Agile Six Sigma Project: Improved Daily Case Completion of the Agency Implementation Team](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1KEqfmpidvvNqqt_SfzbmBxptIdlQ5NVH)

1. Problem Statement: 
* From January 3, 2022 to April 11, 2022, the average daily completed cases of the Agency Implementation Team is at 27 cases versus the target of 30. The operational delays resulted to backlogs and escalations.

2. Project Objective:
* To improve productivity per day with the new process tools from 27 to 30 cases by June 2022.
  
3. Implemented Improvement: 
* Training/calibration at least once a week or whenever needed to familiarize the tools and other process updates.
* Transfer all reference materials from shared drive to Sharepoint for faster access
* Created macro –enabled activity tracker to monitor non-productive hours and identify which ones can be removed or reduced

4. Root Causes: 
* Familiarity to the new tool affecting the processing time
* Additional time spent in accessing the training materials in shared drive
* Management of productive and non-productive hours

5. Final Result
* Through these implementations:
* Meet the target of 30 cases during the execute and validate phase
* Overtime and process efficiency savings of $1,271.48
